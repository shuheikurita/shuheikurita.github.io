## Bio
I’m Shuhei Kurita, researcher of NLP and Deep Learning at RIKEN AIP. I have received Ph.D. of Informatics from Kyoto University, March, 2019.
Now I’m working for RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project aka RIKEN AIP  (Satoshi Sekine PI), Tokyo, Japan.
My research interests are in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Neuroscience, and Statistical and Computational Physics. Currently, my most work has been done with neural networks and deep learning.
