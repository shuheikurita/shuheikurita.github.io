## Bio
I’m Shuhei Kurita, a researcher in NLU and Deep Learning at RIKEN AIP. I have received a Ph.D. of Informatics from Kyoto University in March 2019.
Now I’m working for RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project *aka RIKEN AIP*  (Satoshi Sekine PI), Tokyo, Japan.
My research interests are in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, Neuroscience, and Statistical and Computational Physics. Nowadays I have a keen interest in deep learning via virtual environments such as *vision-and-language navigation*.
