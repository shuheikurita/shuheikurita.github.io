## Bio
I'm a researcher in RIKEN AIP and JST PRESTO. My research interests include natural language processing/understanding (NLP/NLU) with machine learning approaches, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), neuroscience, and statistical/computational physics. Currently, I have a keen interest in deep learning via virtual environments such as [*vision-and-language navigation*](https://bringmeaspoon.org/) and their applications to the real world.<br>
Ph.D. of Informatics (Kyoto University) in March 2019.
